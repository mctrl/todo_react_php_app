# todo_react_php_app

run `docker-compose up` to spin up the backend system

run `npm install` then `npm start` in the app forder to spin up the react app

**NOTE:** in order to allow the react app to pull data from the backend system, you may need to modify the url in the App.js fetch to localhost:4500 instead of the VM IP address

_ToDo: make the react app part of the docker container as well.. watch this space._
